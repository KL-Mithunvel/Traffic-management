# Traffic-management
### A smart Al based solution for traffic management on routes with heavy traffic from different directions, with real-time monitoring and adaptation of traffic light timings.
Background: Urban areas often face significant traffic congestion, especially at intersections where multiple routes converge. Traditional traffic management systems rely on pre-set traffic light timings, which may not adapt well to fluctuating traffic conditions. This can lead to increased waiting times, fuel consumption, and emissions. Description: An AI-based traffic management system can dynamically adjust traffic light timings based on real-time traffic data, improving traffic flow and reducing congestion. Expected Solution: Problem statement is to develop a smart, AI-based traffic management system that can monitor traffic conditions in real-time and adapt traffic light timings accordingly. The system should be capable of handling heavy traffic from multiple directions and optimizing traffic flow to minimize delays and improve overall efficiency.



#To install all required libraries:
1. Create a venv in your project folder using python -m venv c:\path\to\project
2. Activate the venv using :
3. cd c:\path\to\project
4. .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
5.  pip install -r requirements.txt 
6. Your environment is ready. 
7. If you are using pycharm, set proect interpreter as the venv we have created:
8. File > Setting> Project: Settings > Project Interpreter : [Choose the venv you created above]
